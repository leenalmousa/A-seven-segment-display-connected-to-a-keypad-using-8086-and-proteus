# A-seven-segment-display-connected-to-a-keypad-using-8086-and-proteus
This project includes design and implementation of a digital keypad interface using an 8086 microprocessor, an 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI), and a seven-segment display. The project focuses on interfacing these components to accurately read key presses from a 4x3 matrix keypad and display the corresponding digit on the seven-segment display. The 8255 PPI plays a crucial role in managing input from the keypad and output to the display, while the 8086 provides the processing logic for scanning the keypad and generating the appropriate seven-segment codes. 74LS138 decoder is implemented to address the 8255, adhering to the specific requirements outlined in the project documentation.
